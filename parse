I have a resume in text format that I would like to convert into JSON. The JSON should include the following keys:

"name"
"contact_information" (with nested keys for "email", "phone", "address")
"summary"
"experience" (an array of objects with keys for "company", "position", "location", "start_date", "end_date", "responsibilities")
"education" (an array of objects with keys for "institution", "degree", "field_of_study", "start_date", "end_date", "location")
"skills" (an array of strings)
"projects" (an array of objects with keys for "name", "description", "technologies_used")
"certifications" (an array of objects with keys for "name", "issuing_organization", "issue_date", "expiration_date")
"languages" (an array of strings)
Here is the resume text:
